## Pong
Pong is one of the earliest arcade video games. It is a table tennis sports
game featuring simple two-dimensional graphics. The game was originally manufactured by Atari, which released it in 1972.

### Gameplay
Pong is a two-dimensional sports game that simulates table tennis.
The player controls an in-game paddle by moving it vertically across the
left or right side of the screen. They can compete against another player
controlling a second paddle on the opposing side. Players use the paddles to
hit a ball back and forth. The goal is for each player to reach eleven
points before the opponent; points are earned when one fails to
return the ball to the other.
